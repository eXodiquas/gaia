Gaia allows easy usage of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.

## Current State

Currently only basic calculations are possible. Only real variables can be used as genes (at least in a somewhat comfortable manner).
I am 100% positive that, currently, it is possible to break the library by just looking at it in the wrong way, if you find any wrong behaviour or any arcane error message or anything does not work as expected, please hit me with an issue.

## Example Usage

```lisp
;; Calculate the maximum of f(x) = -x² + 100. Which should be 100. :P

(let ((p (new-population-initialized 100 (lambda (x) (apply (lambda (y) (+ (- (* y y)) 100)) x)) :gene-amount 1)))
    (loop for count upto 100 do
      (setf p (next-generation p)))
    (population-fitness p))

```
The result of this calculation is ~99.9999, which is close enough. At least we didn't have to do the algebra. AMIRIGHT?

This chunky looking piece of code first binds a pre-initialized population with fitness function f(x) = -x² + 100 to the local variable p. :gene-amount tells us how many genes an individual should have. We only want 1 gene per individual, otherwise it would not fit with our fitness function.
A pre-initialized population runs on :real values with a mutation rate of 5%.
Then we loop 100 times (arbitrary number, but we have to stop somewhere).
Each loop iteration we set p to the next generation.
After 100 steps we return the average fitness of the population. We could also get the fittest individual and return its fitness.

## Next Steps

- [X] Individuals
- [X] Populations
- [X] Crossover
- [X] Mutation

Now that basic evaluation is possible I want to implement more strategies.

- [ ] Tournament Selection
- [ ] Stochastic Uniform Sampling Selection
- [ ] Bit-Strings as gene type for individuals
- [ ] Mutation for integers
- [ ] Mutation for bit-strings
- [ ] Make parameter accessible (like for example, what proportion of the N best individuals should be used for uniform recombination)
- [ ] Macro to not always have to write (lambda (x) (apply #'fun x)) as fitness function
- [ ] Make it easier to setup maximizing or minimizing algorithms

Also I want to implement monitoring.
- [ ] Console output to see progress
- [ ] Log files to look at progress
- [ ] Creating a graph to easy see the development of the population

Improvements for the future

- [ ] Implement fitness functions in a neater way(tm)
